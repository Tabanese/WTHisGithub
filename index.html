			Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
			Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
			Simple is better than complex.<br>
			Complex is better than complicated.<br>
			Flat is better than nested.<br>
			Sparse is better than dense.<br>
			Readability counts.<br>
			Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
			Although practicality beats purity.<br>
			Errors should never pass silently.<br>
			Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
			In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
			There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
			Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
			Now is better than never.<br>
			Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
			If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
			If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
			Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>
